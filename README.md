# Streamlit–MySQL Inventory Management System

## Project Description
A full-stack web application that provides a user interface for managing inventory and operational data stored in a MySQL database. The system enables users to perform database operations such as product creation, stock updates, reorder management, and history tracking directly from the UI, without writing SQL queries. The application is designed to simplify inventory operations, enforce structured workflows, and centralize data handling through a controlled interface.

## Features
- Add new products with automatic updates across related tables.
- View product inventory history (shipments, stock entries, restocks, sales).
- Display inventory metrics such as total products, total suppliers, category distribution, and recent sales/restock values.
- Identify items below reorder levels.
- Place and receive reorders through a guided interface.
- Access supplier information and product details in organized tables.

## Technology Stack
